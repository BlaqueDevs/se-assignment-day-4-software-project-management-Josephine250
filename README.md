Code Reviews & Peer Programming – Regularly review code to identify issues early.
Automated & Manual Testing – Use unit tests, functional tests, and UI tests to ensure reliability.
Test-Driven Development (TDD) – Write tests before writing the actual code to improve quality.
Security & Performance Testing – Identify vulnerabilities and optimize performance.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT) – Validate with real users to ensure functionality meets expectations.
Bug Tracking & Issue Resolution – Use tools like Jira or Bugzilla to track and fix defects efficiently.
Importance of Maintaining High Standards
Reliability & Stability – Ensures the software functions without crashes or errors.
User Satisfaction – High-quality software improves user experience and trust.
Cost Savings – Catching defects early prevents expensive fixes later.
Security & Compliance – Protects sensitive data and ensures regulatory compliance.
Brand Reputation – Poor quality software can damage a company’s reputation.
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining the project scope is essential for successful project planning because it:

Prevents Scope Creep – Avoids uncontrolled changes that can lead to delays and cost overruns.
Sets Clear Objectives – Ensures all stakeholders understand deliverables and expectations.
Improves Resource Allocation – Helps in planning personnel, time, and budget efficiently.
Enhances Risk Management – Identifies potential risks early for better mitigation strategies.
Facilitates Better Communication – Aligns the team and stakeholders with a shared vision.
A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical breakdown of a project into smaller, manageable tasks or work packages. It helps organize work into structured phases, deliverables, and subtasks.

wbs is very important according to the following steps
Improves Task Clarity – Breaks complex projects into smaller, easier-to-manage parts.
Enhances Time & Cost Estimation – Provides a structured approach to budgeting and scheduling.
Aids in Team Coordination – Assigns responsibilities efficiently and avoids confusion.
Tracks Progress Easily – Helps monitor completion of tasks and milestones.
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
